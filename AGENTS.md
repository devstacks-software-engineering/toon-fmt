# Agent Guidelines

## Commit Message Convention

- **Start with Issue ID:** Always start the commit message with the issue number (e.g., `#1`).
- **No Prefixes:** Do not use conventional commit prefixes like `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.
- **Detailed Description:** If the commit involves multiple changes, include a bulleted list in the description detailing the work done.

**Example:**
```text
#123 Implement user login

- Added login form component
- Created authentication service
- Updated route configuration
```
